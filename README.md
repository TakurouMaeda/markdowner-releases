# Markdowner Release

Markdowner Release is a repository for managing releases of the Markdowner project.

## For Mac

After you download the app and drag it to your `Applications` folder, you will face difficulties opening it because I'm not enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. To bypass this, you will need to run this in your terminal:

```shell
xattr -c /Applications/Marker.app
```

After that, you should be able to open the app with no issues.

## Usage

Please refer to the releases section of this repository for the latest versions of Markdowner.
